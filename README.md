# Graph-Based Legal IR

Public documentation and release harness for evidence-first legal information retrieval in Chilean law.

This repository is intentionally public-facing. It documents the architecture, methodology, release posture, and demo surface of the LexCon / LexO ecosystem without exposing vault contents, private execution traces, or lab-only implementation details.

The central promise is simple:
- exact textual evidence before conclusion
- traceable relations before promotion
- fail-closed abstention when evidence is insufficient
- human review for ambiguous or high-impact relations

## What this repo is for

This repo is the public story of a system that does not want to be clever first. It wants to be verifiable first.

It packages:
- the architecture of the layered legal IR stack
- the evidence-first methodology
- the current status of the public release surface
- the release policy and demo plan
- a compact narrative suitable for GitHub and portfolio review

## What this repo is not

- not the private vault
- not the internal notebook of the lab
- not a claim of full legal coverage
- not autonomous legal advice
- not a place for raw corpora, unreviewed outputs, or half-finished internal experiments

## Current ecosystem view

| Layer | Component | Role |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | n8n-judicial | Acquisition and normalization from public legal sources |
| 1 | IndexO + sentence-index | Retrieval, ranking, and surfacing of candidate evidence |
| 2 | legal-reviewer | Human curation, labels, and goldset construction |
| 3 | review-graph | Pending / approved / rejected / expired relation lifecycle |
| 4 | graph-legal-ir | Canonical graph with hash-backed evidence and human validation gates |
| 5 | LexO | Reasoning harness and subagent orchestration over grounded evidence |
| 6 | LexCon-hub + public apps | Public-facing navigation, orientation, and product surfaces |

## Why this matters

Traditional legal search gives documents, keyword hits, or fluent answers without a stable evidence path. This project is built to solve a narrower but more important problem: how to make legal retrieval explainable, auditable, and safe to trust.

That means the system must be able to say:
- where a relation came from
- why it was promoted
- what evidence supports it
- when it should refuse to answer

## Short version for GitHub

What it does:
- documents an evidence-first legal IR architecture
- explains the review graph and canonical graph split
- shows how LexO reasons only over grounded material
- provides a public-facing release harness with clear limits

Why it matters:
- legal AI is only useful when its evidence path can be inspected
- public trust requires abstention, not confident guessing
- the same architecture that helps researchers also reduces risk for productization
